Of course the {% static %} template tag 
is not available for use in static files 
like your stylesheet which arenâ€™t generated by Django. 
You should always use relative paths to link your 
static files between each other, 
because then you can change STATIC_URL 
(used by the static template tag to generate its URLs) 
without having to modify a bunch of paths in your static files as well.
